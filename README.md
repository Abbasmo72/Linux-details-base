Bash script retrieves the number of online users, their access types, the Linux version, and the system uptime


This Bash script is designed to provide information about online users, their access types, the Linux version running on the system, and the system's uptime. It utilizes various command-line utilities to gather and display this information effectively. Below is a detailed analysis of the script's functionality and components.

Functionality Overview:
Counting Online Users:

The script uses the who command to list currently logged-in users and pipes the output to wc -l to count the number of lines, which corresponds to the number of online users. It then prints this count to the console.
Access Types of Users:

The script iterates over each logged-in user obtained from the who command. For each user, it retrieves the user's group memberships using the groups command and formats the output to display the user's name along with their associated access types (groups).
Displaying Linux Version:

The script fetches the version of the Linux distribution using the lsb_release -a command. This command provides detailed information about the Linux distribution, including its name and version.
System Uptime:

The script utilizes the uptime -p command to display how long the system has been running since the last boot. The -p option presents the uptime in a human-readable format.

Code Breakdown:
Counting Online Users:
echo "Number of online users:"
who | wc -l

This section prints a header and uses who to list users, with wc -l counting the number of lines (users).
Access Types of Users:
echo -e "\nAccess types of users:"
for user in $(who | awk '{print $1}'); do
    echo "$user: $(groups $user | awk -F: '{print $2}')"
    
This loop iterates through each user and fetches their group information, formatting it for better readability.
Displaying Linux Version:
echo -e "\nLinux version:"
lsb_release -a
This command retrieves and displays information about the Linux distribution being used.
System Uptime:
echo -e "\nSystem uptime:"
uptime -p
This command outputs the system's uptime in a concise, user-friendly format.
Key Features:
Real-time Information Retrieval: The script provides real-time data about the current state of the system, including user activity and system health.

User-Friendly Output: The information is printed in a structured manner, making it easy for users to understand the current system status.

Comprehensive System Overview: The script covers essential aspects of the system, including user information, OS details, and uptime, giving users a quick overview.

Possible Enhancements:
Error Handling: The script can be improved by adding error handling to check for command availability (e.g., who, groups, lsb_release, uptime) and handling cases where there are no logged-in users.

Output Formatting: Further formatting can be added to improve the presentation of the data, such as aligning columns for better readability.

Logging Feature: Implementing a logging feature to save the output to a file could be beneficial for later analysis or monitoring purposes.

User Filtering: Adding options to filter users based on specific criteria (e.g., users from a specific group) could enhance usability.

Use Cases:
System Monitoring: This script is useful for system administrators who need to monitor user activity and system performance in real-time.

Security Auditing: By listing users and their access types, the script can help identify potential security risks associated with user permissions.

General System Information: Users who want to quickly check their system's status, including the OS version and uptime, can benefit from this script.
